# ElevatorWorld

ElevatorWorld is a code sample where NPCs take an elevator to navigate in a building.

Each NPC is randomly spawned on a random floor with a random desired floor. 
NPCs take the elevator to go to their deisred floors. 

The elevator acts realistically and has a limited capacity; it cannot host more people if the capacity is reached. 

The code is mostly scalable and modular; more floors and more NPCs can easily be added by changing a single parameter.
